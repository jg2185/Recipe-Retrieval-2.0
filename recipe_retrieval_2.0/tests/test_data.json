      "instructions": "For Pie Dough:\nCombine flour, cornmeal, baking powder, salt and sugar. Using the paddle of an electric mixer or a pastry cutter, cut in the butter and shortening until mixture resembles \"small peas.\" Pour the vanilla extract over the dough. Pour ice water, a little at a time, over the dough, and mix lightly until the dough comes together. Separate dough into 2 pieces and flatten each piece like a pancake. Wrap each piece of dough separately in plastic wrap. Refrigerate for at least 2 hours.\nFor Pie Filling:\nCombine rhubarb and strawberries in a big bowl. Combine sugar, flour and scraped vanilla bean seeds and mix in with fruit mixture. Let sit while rolling pie dough.\nPreheat oven to 425 degrees F. Butter a 9-inch glass pie plate. Roll 1/2 pie dough to approximately 1/8-inch thick and about 1 inch larger than the pie plate. Fit in into the pie pan leaving the overlap intact. Fill with fruit filling and dot top with 2 tablespoons of unsalted butter. Brush beaten egg with pastry brush around the rim of the pie. Roll out the remaining dough and make a lattice top. Crimp the edges. Brush lattice with beaten egg. Do not brush the edge of the pie--this will cause the dough to become too dark while baking. Generously sprinkle with crystal sugar. Bake for 10 minutes. Lower oven temperature to 350 degrees F and bake for an additional hour. Pie is done when golden brown and juices bubbling from pie appear thickened.",

Sprinkle in the butter pieces and cut them into the flour with a pastry cutter (or 2 knives or your fingertips) until the mixture is crumbly and the pieces are the size of small peas. Mix in 5 tablespoons very cold water and toss with a fork until the dough just comes together.\nPlace the dough on the floured counter and knead a few times, just to make a ball. Don't overwork the dough or the crust will be tough! Lightly flour the counter. Flatten the dough into a disk and wrap in plastic. Let it rest in the refrigerator for at least 15 minutes. (If making more than 1 hour ahead, let it rest on the counter for 10 minutes before rolling out.)\nRoll the dough out on a floured surface into a 12-inch circle.

Remove from the heat and stir in the butter and vanilla. Slice 2 bananas into the cooled pastry crust. Top with half of the custard and slice the remaining bananas on top. Top with the rest of the custard. Chill for at least 1 hour.\nFor the whipped cream, in a cold bowl with an electric mixer, beat the cream, confectioners' sugar, and vanilla until firm peaks form.

      "instructions": "Cut the tubes into rings. Lightly coat the squid with flour and fry 360 degree F oil until golden brown. We make this pizza the same way as the margarita except that the spicy oil is drizzled on instead of just olive oil and then the calamari is placed on top, and garnished with scallions.\nPrepare a hot charcoal fire, setting the grill rack 3 to 4 inches above the coals.\nOn a large, oiled, inverted baking sheet, spread and flatten the pizza dough with your hands into a 10 to 12-inch free-form circle, 1/8-inch thick. Do not make a lip. You may end up with a rectangle rather than a circle; the shape is unimportant, but do take care to maintain an even thickness.\nWhen the fire is hot (when you can hold your hand over the coals for 3 to 4 seconds at a distance of 5 inches), use your fingertips to lift the dough gently by the 2 corners closest to you, and drape in onto the grill. Catch the loose edge on the grill first and slide the remaining dough into place over the fire. Within a minute the dough will puff slightly, the underside will stiffen, and grill marks will appear.\nUsing tongs, immediately flip the crust over, onto the coolest part of the grill. Quickly brush the grilled surface with olive oil. Scatter the garlic and cheeses over the dough, and spoon dollops of tomato over the cheese. Do not cover the entire surface of the pizza with tomatoes. Finally, drizzle the pizza with 1 to 2 tablespoons of olive oil.\nSlide the pizza back toward the hot coals, but not directly over them. Using tongs, rotate the pizza frequently so that different sections receive high heat; check the underside often to see that it is not burning. The pizza is done when the top is bubbly and the cheese melted, about 6 to 8 minutes. Serve at once, topped with the basil leaves and additional olive oil, if desired.\nPizza Dough: Sprinkle the yeast over 1/2 cup warm (105 to 110 degrees F) water and allow it to dissolve and activate, about 5 minutes. Combine the flour and salt and mound it onto a cool work surface creating a high walled well in the center. Combine the yeast mixture with 1 1/2 cups of cool water and pour into the well. Slowly begin to mix the water and flour, a little at a time, moving your fingers in short, counter clockwise circles around the border of the water. When the dough is firm enough to hold it's shape, scrape the remaining flour over it and knead until the mass is smooth and shiny, approximately 7 minutes. Transfer the dough to a bowl that has been brushed with olive oil. Brush the top of the dough with olive oil to prevent a skin from forming, cover the bowl with plastic wrap, and let rise in a warm place away from drafts until doubled in bulk, about 2 hours. Punch down the dough and knead once more. Let the dough rise again for about 40 minutes, punch down again and form dough into 4 balls.\nCombine all the ingredients in a heavy saucepan. Bring to a boil, lower the heat to very low, and gently simmer for 10 minutes. Remove from the heat and set aside for 30 minutes so the flavors continue to infuse the oil as it cools\nStrain the oil into a clean jar. When it has cooled to room temperature, cover and refrigerate.",

      "instructions": "Make the dough: Put 2 1/4 cups warm (100 degrees F) water in a large measuring cup; stir in the yeast to dissolve, then stir in the sugar and olive oil. Let stand until bubbly, 3 to 5 minutes. Combine 5 cups flour and 2 teaspoons salt in a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment. Add the yeast mixture and mix on medium-low speed, adding a little more flour or water, if needed, until a rough, sticky ball of dough forms, about 1 minute. Let rest 5 minutes, then mix on medium low until no longer sticky, about 1 more minute. Transfer the dough to an oiled surface and knead with oiled hands until smooth, about 10 times. Let rest 5 minutes, then knead briefly again and transfer to an oiled bowl. Cover with plastic wrap; refrigerate at least 8 hours or overnight. Divide the dough into 4 balls, dust with flour and cover loosely with plastic wrap. Let sit at room temperature 2 hours before making the pizzas.\nMake the sauce: Crush the tomatoes in a bowl using your hands. Stir in the olive oil, garlic, 1 1/2 teaspoons salt and the oregano. Cover and let stand 2 hours. Position a pizza stone or inverted baking sheet on the lowest oven rack; preheat to 500 degrees F for at least 30 minutes. Stretch each ball of dough into a 12-to-14-inch round on individual sheets of parchment paper. Let rest 15 minutes. Remove and discard the garlic from the sauce. Spread a thin layer of sauce on each pizza, leaving a border. Top with one-quarter each of the mozzarella, parmesan, cherry peppers, soppressata and radicchio; drizzle with olive oil. Slide 1 pizza (on the parchment) onto a pizza peel or another inverted baking sheet, then slide onto the hot stone in the oven. Bake until the crust browns, 12 to 15 minutes. Top with oregano. Repeat to make 3 more pizzas. Photograph by Con Poulos",

      "instructions": "For the cupcakes: Preheat the convection oven to 325 degrees F or a standard oven to 350 degrees F.\nIn large mixer bowl, cream together the granulated sugar and butter until light and fluffy with a heavy duty mixer. Add the eggs, one at a time, and mix thoroughly after each addition. Add the coconut extract and mix well. Combine the flour, baking soda and salt. Add half of the flour to the mixer bowl along with 1/2 cup of the half-and-half. Mix until the flour is mixed in, scraping the sides of the bowl with a rubber spatula. Add the rest of flour mixture and the other 1/2 cup half-and-half. Mix until the batter is smooth and all of the flour lumps are gone. Fold in the coconut flakes.\nFill 24 cupcake liners half full and bake for 20 minutes in the convection oven or 28 minutes in the standard oven. The tops of the cupcakes should be lightly browned. Check the cupcakes to make sure no batter sticks to a wooden toothpick when inserted into the cupcake. Cool the cupcakes completely.\nFor the mousse filling: In large mixer bowl, beat the heavy cream, half-and-half, coconut extract and pudding mix until light and fluffy using a heavy duty mixer. It should have the consistency of whipped cream. Gently fold in the coconut using a plastic spatula. Put the filling in a pastry bag or zipper bag with a corner cut off.\nFor the coconut buttercream: In large mixer bowl, beat together the butter and half of the powdered sugar using heavy duty mixer. Add the half-and-half and the rest of the powdered sugar, along with the coconut extract, and mix well. If the frosting is thicker than you would like, add 1 teaspoon of additional half-and-half at a time, mixing well after each addition, until the frosting reaches the correct consistency. The thickness may depend on the humidity levels in your region. Put into a pastry bag.\nTo assemble: Make a hole in the middle of each cupcake using a sharp knife. Be sure and leave a small amount of cake in the bottom of the hole. Fill the cupcakes with the mousse filling. Frost with coconut buttercream. You may top the cupcakes with more flake coconut or toasted coconut as desired.\nServe immediately or chill until ready to serve.",

      "instructions": "Preheat oven to 425 degree F.\nHave your butcher tie the pork roast into the traditional crown roast shape, chine bone removed, split between the ribs to facilitate the formation of the crown shape. Ask for the chine bone which will be used to roast the meat on to avoid burning the bottom. In a saucepan over medium heat combine the pureed Ancho chili, tomato puree, honey, vinegar, Worcestershire, black pepper, ground cumin and garlic. Bring the ingredients to a simmer and allow to cook for 20 minutes before removing from the heat and adding the bourbon.\nSeason the roast with salt and pepper and brush with Ancho marinade. Place the chine bone in a roasting pan and place the pork roast on the bones: this will prevent the bottom of the roast from burning. Place the roasting pan into the oven and cook for 20 minutes before turning the heat down to 350 degrees F. Brush the roast at frequent intervals during the cooking process to keep the roast moist as well as perfumed with the spice mixture. Add the roughly cut vegetables and continue to cook until the roast reaches an internal temperature of 150 degrees F. Remove the roast from the pan and allow to stand for 20 minutes before carving. While the roast is resting make the quick pan gravy by pouring off all of the rendered pork fat, leaving the rough cut vegetables in the pan. Place the roasting pan on the stove top, turn the burner on underneath the roasting pan and continue to cook the vegetables with the chine bone. Carefully deglaze the pan by adding the wine allowing most of the liquid to cook off before adding the hot chicken broth, reducing the heat to a simmer. Meanwhile in a small saucepan combine the 3 tablespoons of pork fat with the flour and cook gently to make a light brown roux, cooking about 3 to 4 minutes. Using a wire whisk, add the roux to the simmering stock and whip the ingredients together to avoid lumping. Add any remaining marinade to the gravy, then cook for 5 minutes before straining through a fine mesh strainer.\nServe the roast, by carving at the table, with the dressing and gravy on the side.",

      "instructions": "In the top half of a double boiler set over barely simmering water, stir the chocolate until melted. Using a pastry brush, brush the baked pie shell up to the rim with the melted chocolate. Set aside to cool and harden at room temperature or, uncovered, in the refrigerator. In a large saucepan, bring the milk, cream of coconut, and vanilla bean to a simmer over medium heat. Immediately turn off the heat and set aside to infuse for 15 minutes.\nMeanwhile, in a mixer fitted with a whisk attachment (or using a hand mixer), whip the egg yolks and sugar together until pale yellow and fluffy. With the mixer running at low speed, mix in the cornstarch, then gradually pour in the hot milk mixture.\nStrain the mixture back into the saucepan to smooth it and remove the vanilla bean. Whisking constantly, cook over medium-high heat until thick and just boiling. When the mixture thickens, the whisk will leave trail marks on the bottom of the pot and the mixture will have a few large bubbles boiling up to the top. Pour the mixture into a medium bowl and stir in the butter. Half-fill a large bowl with ice water. Rest the bowl containing the custard in the ice water and let cool, stirring frequently to cool the mixture. When the custard is cool, whip the cream until stiff. Fold the whipped cream and coconut into the custard. Pour the mixture into the chocolate-coated pie shell and smooth the top. Refrigerate uncovered at least 2 hours. (Or refrigerate until ready to serve, up to 24 hours.) Serve cold.\nIn a mixer fitted with a paddle attachment (or using a hand mixer), mix the flour, salt, and sugar for 1 minute. Add the butter and mix just until you have a crumbly, sandy mixture. You should still be able to see the pieces of butter. In a small bowl, stir the water and vinegar together. With the mixer running at medium speed, drizzle in the water-vinegar mixture and mix just until a dough forms. You should still see small bits of butter.\nTurn out onto a work surface, divide the dough in 1/2, and shape into 2 round, flat disks. Wrap separately in plastic wrap and refrigerate at least 30 minutes before using. (Or, refrigerate up to 48 hours or freeze up to 1 month before using. If frozen, let thaw in the refrigerator overnight before rolling out.) When the time comes to roll out the dough, let the dough warm up for a few minutes at room temperature. Dust a work surface with just a few tablespoons of flour and keep some extra flour at hand. If you like, you can roll out the dough between 2 sheets of waxed paper (flouring the bottom sheet and the top of the dough before rolling), which makes it much easier to transfer to the pan later on. However, you won't be able to check the progress of the dough as easily. It's entirely up to you.\nSprinkle a little flour on top of the dough and start rolling outward from the center with quick, light strokes. Don't worry if the edges split a bit; concentrate on getting a good circle going from the center. Lift up and rotate the dough 1/4 turn every minute or so to help ensure even rolling. The dough should feel smooth and soft; some say it should feel like the inside of your forearm. If it gets sticky, sprinkle on a bit more flour, but don't do this more than 2 or 3 times; the dough will absorb too much flour. Instead, put it back in refrigerator for 15 minutes to firm the butter up. Keep rolling until the circle is at least 2 inches larger than your pan (for example, 11 inches wide for a 9-inch pie pan), or 3 inches larger for deep-dish pies.\nSet your pie or tart pan nearby. We always use heavy aluminum pans, because glass pans seem to bake the crust too fast. However, we know that the advantage of glass is that you can easily check the color of the crust. Again, it's up to you. Either choice will work.\nTo transfer the crust to the pan, we find it easiest to roll a finished crust up onto the rolling pin, then gently unroll it in the pan. Or, you can fold it gently in quarters, lift it up, position the center point on the center of the pan, and unfold it into the pan. If using waxed paper, peel off the top layer, turn the crust gently into the pan, and peel off the remaining paper. Make sure that the dough is allowed to settle completely into the pan.\nDon't stretch and press the dough into the corners; stretched dough will likely shrink back when you bake it. Instead, lift the edges of the crust to let it settle down into the corners. If the dough tears a bit, don't be concerned; we'll patch it in a minute. Using scissors or a sharp knife, trim the dough to within 3/4-inch of the rim. Use any extra scraps to patch the crust, pressing with your fingers (wet them if necessary) or set aside.\nWorking around the rim, turn the crust under itself (not under the rim of the pan) to make a thick edge, pressing it firmly against the pan to reduce shrinkage. To decorate the rim, just press it all around with the back of a fork. For a slightly more advanced look, press the thumb and forefinger of one hand together. Use them to gently push the thick dough rim outward, while pushing inward with the forefinger of the other hand, so that they intersect in a \"V\" with the dough in between. Repeat all around the rim to make a wavy edge. Chill 20 minutes before baking.\nHeat the oven to 375 degrees. Line the inside of the chilled crust with aluminum foil (don't turn down over the rim, but leave the extra sticking up so that you have something to hold on to). Fill the foil all the way up to the top of the shell with pie weights, rice, or dried beans. (Pie weights are reusable metal or ceramic pellets that hold the crust in place as it bakes. You can buy them at cooking supply stores.) Bake 25 to 30 minutes, until dry and beginning to turn \"blond\". Lift the foil and weights out of the shell and bake another 10 to 15 minutes, checking frequently to prevent overbaking, until medium brown.",

Now cut your butter into small cubes with your bench knife or straight edge knife and place into the bowl. Using your pastry cutter, cut the butter into the dry mixture in a downward twisting motion until you reach a sandy texture. At this point, your dry mix should feel like beach sand, but if there are some slightly larger pieces of butter remaining this is okay. Those pieces will create the flaky effect when the biscuits begin to cook. Now, create a well in the center of your bowl of dry ingredients. Pour the buttermilk into the center of the bowl. Using your hands (this will feel funny and get messy), incorporate all the ingredients until the dough begins to come together and become one.\nNow put a small amount of flour on a flat surface and continue to bring the dough together, making sure not to knead the dough or overwork it. Use some of that extra flour to bring it all together and get the dough off your fingers too. Now spread out and flatten the dough so it's about the height of your flattened hand. Using your biscuit cutter (dip it in some flour to keep any dough from sticking to it), cut out 24 biscuits, reworking the dough if need be. Place a piece of parchment paper on your cookie sheet and line up the cut biscuits, 4 by 6. Place the biscuits into the oven and cook until golden brown, about 20 minutes.

      "instructions": "Watch how to make this recipe.\nMake the eggs: In a large nonstick pan or two medium nonstick pans, add the butter (do the division if using 2 pans). Turn the pan on low and allow the butter to gently melt without browning. Once it is melted, tilt and swirl the pan to coat the bottom and the sides (this will help you slide the eggs out later).\nOk, pay close attention: We are going to Frankenyolk these eggs. That means you'll make one egg have two yolks. (If you get lucky and get a double-yolk jumbo egg, go buy a lottery ticket.) Crack one egg into the pan. Then separate the second egg over a bowl, leaving just the yolk in one side of the shell and the whites in the bowl. Take the yolk in the shell and, using the edge of the shell, gently break the thick clear albumen (egg white) of the egg already in the pan and pour the separated yolk right next to the other yolk. Keep the yolks next to each other so they cook at the same time. Repeat this process with the rest of the eggs so you have 4 eggs with 2 yolks each. What to do with the whites? Make an egg white omelet the next day if you feel guilty. If not, how about a meringue pie for dessert tonight? Haaaiii!!\nCook the eggs on medium-low heat until the whites are cooked through and the yolks are still runny. This takes a good 8 to 10 minutes, so be patient and work on the other steps. Brown edges on a fried egg are just wrong in my book. If the eggs finish before the other steps, just remove the pan(s) from the heat.\nCook the refried beans: In a medium pot, add the oil and chorizo and cook on medium heat, using a wavy potato masher or wooden spoon to break the chorizo into bits to create crumbles like ground beef. Once the orange fat is rendered, add the onions, a tiny pinch of salt and cumin and the garlic and cook, stirring them into the chorizo. When the onions are tender and stained with the fat of the chorizo, add the refried beans and chopped pickled jalapenos. Cook until the beans are softened and loose. If they dry up a bit, add a splash of water or, if you are feeling slightly dangerous, add a bit of the pickling juice from the jalapenos. Keep warm.\nChar the tortillas: In a large dry pan (cast-iron, please) or griddle over high heat, add the stack of tortillas. Cook and flip in a way that once the bottom tortilla is charred, it moves to the top of the stack, flipped. Continue to flip and alternate sides until each tortilla has had a date with the bottom of the pan. Time to build your plate!\nBuild your plate: Place equal amount of the refried beans on each plate. Slightly level them out with the back of your spoon. Sprinkle each with an equal amount of cheese and then slide a double-yolk sunny-side up egg on top. Sprinkle some pico de gallo around the edges so you don't mess with the yolks. Season each yolk with salt and a crack of black pepper. Sprinkle the entire plate with cilantro and spritz with lime juice and a shake of hot sauce. Serve each plate with 2 folded charred tortillas.",

      "instructions": "Heat the heavy cream in a 2-quart heavy-bottomed saucepan until bubbles begin to form around the edge of the pan. Make sure you chopped the chocolate as finely as possible to allow it to melt quickly and easily. Place the chopped chocolate in a medium-size mixing bowl. Make a ganache by pouring about half of the hot cream over the chocolate and letting it sit for 30 seconds to melt the chocolate. Then, slowly whisk until smooth and homogenous. Do not add all of the hot cream to the cold chocolate at once. The shock of the temperature extremes will cause the fat in the chocolate to separate. As the chocolate melts, you will see some elasticity if there is no fat separation. This means the chocolate still has an emulsion; the fat molecules are still holding together. If the ganache separates, it loses its elasticity, collapses, and becomes very liquid. I use a hand-held immersion blender to ensure a smooth ganache and to keep the emulsion of the chocolate. Add the remaining cream gradually and mix until all of the hot cream is incorporated and the ganache is smooth and homogenous.\nIf the ganache separates, it is very easy to fix. Simply add a small amount of cold cream and whisk well. This will bring the ganache back together. The ganache should be thick, shiny, and smooth. Add the desired flavoring and mix until fully incorporated. Pour the ganache onto a plastic wrap-covered baking sheet and spread evenly with a rubber spatula. Cover the ganache with plastic wrap and allow it to cool for at least 4 hours at room temperature. I usually make the ganache at the end of the day and let it cool overnight. As it cools, it will thicken and set.\nWhen the ganache has cooled to the consistency of toothpaste, use an offset spatula to cover the cake layer with the ganache.",

Using your fingers, gently loosen the skin from the breasts and drumsticks and slip the sage leaves underneath. Rub the entire surface with 1/4 cup of the melted butter. Lightly sprinkle the skin and cavity with salt and pepper.\nTruss the turkey and place on a rack in a large roasting pan. Roast for about 45 minutes, until brown, basting with the remaining butter every 10 minutes. Reduce the temperature to 350 F and continue roasting for another 1 1/4 hours or until an instant-read thermometer inserted in the thigh registers 180 degrees F.

Remove the bowl from the machine, remove the blade and bring the dough together by hand.\nForm the dough into a disk, wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate until thoroughly chilled, at least 1 hour.\nFor the filling: Put the lemon juice in a medium bowl. Peel, halve and core the apples. Cut each half into 4 wedges. Toss the apples with the lemon juice. Add the sugar and toss to combine evenly.\nMelt the butter over medium-high heat in a large skillet. Add the apples and cook, stirring, until the sugar dissolves and the mixture begins to simmer, about 2 minutes.
